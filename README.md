#Blocks

#Guidelines
* This mod focuses on two branches of tech, liquid, and solid to guide the player from tier to tier
* Each tier of progression requires the same level of tech from the other side of tree
* Ultimately this culminates in endgame tech, the MSR
* Similar to rotarycraft/reactorcraft, the MSR will require entire processing chains set up and represent a significant investment in resources
* Endgame in this mod means there will be a use for millions of ingots but not bog down the player with gregtech-style grindiness
* A unix philosophy guides the creation of machines, as each is designed to do one thing great, but that same expertise allows the player to use combinations and interactions to produce results that alone the components could not
* No Super machines, the first machines you make, when provided with additional power/resources become endgame
* Factorio inspired liquid processing
* Emulate factorio progression
    * Advancement in tech requires hitting certain breakpoint items
    * Further advancement requires mass automation of breakpoints
        * This design philosophy discourages hand crafting and potentially rushing autocrafting
* Tap Buildcraft oil if possible for early game
* Power features kinetic, and in higher tech, rf
* Multiblock featured, including multiblocks built early game such as the oil well
    * Machines that feel like multiblocks, but are distintly separate  machines
    * Give a multiblock feel, but including engineering the components to work together
    * Also allows for much customization of machines, ala opencomputers
        * Tradeoffs, not just boring tiered speed/output upgrades ala thermal expansion
* Ore processing 
    * Allow 5x ore processing if entire chain is complete
    * Each step requires a progression in the next tier of tech
    * Crushing -> Grinding -> Floating - Leaching
* Pollution system?
    * Balance polution with power
    * Environmental cleanup machines?
    * Polluting environment spreads corruption, causes random disease ticks
* Statistics pipe
    * Track throughput of items/energy going through pipe
* Fluid Hopper
    * Low tech fluid option - pre-pipes

#World Generation
* Nickel Ore
    * oreNickel
* Molybdenite Ore
    * oreMolybdenite
    * Smelts into Molybdenite Ingot
    * Ore processing turns into components, 4SO2 + 2MoO3
* Chromite Ore
    * oreChromite
    * Smelts into Chromite Ingot
    * Ore processing turns int components
* Oil

#Progression
##Liquid
1. T1 - Oil Well
    * Kerosene powering engines
    * Multiblock 
    * Crude oil dug from ground
        * similar to buildcraft mining drill?
    * Natural gas produced in small quantities
        * gas well? t2?
    * Uses shaft power to pump oil
2. T2 - Offshore Well
    * Gasoline powering turbines/power plants
3. T3 - Fracking
    * Jet fuel powering turbines

##Solid
1. T1 - Ore Crushing
2. T2 - Ore Separation
    * Chemical Reaction Chamber
3. T3 - Alloy Smeltery
    * Basic alloys, 2-3 ingredients, invar/electrum
4. T4 - Intermediate Alloys 
    * Intermediate, 3-4 ingredient  alloys
5. T5 - Advanced Alloys
    * Superalloys

##Machines
* Alloy Smeltery
    * Multiblock
    * Smelts various superalloys(4+ ingredients)
* Electropolisher
    * Multiblock
    * Polishes super alloys to increase strength
    * Requires huge amounts of power
* Crystallizer
    * Grows metal crystals for use in turbines and other extreme environments
* Chemical Reaction Chamber
    * Multiblock
    * Creates more advanced chemicals by combining liquid + dust 

#Items
##Ingots
* Hastelloy Ingot
    * Parts created from degrade over time unless electropolished
    * Cr, Mo, Fe, Ni
* Nuclear Graphite Ingot
    * Coal smelted into graphite then polished in the Electropolisher turned into 
    

##Components
-Graphite Core
    * Crafted from Nuclear Graphite Ingot
